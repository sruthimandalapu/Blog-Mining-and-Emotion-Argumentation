(1, 'Iphone SE3', ' The second-generation iPhone SE (also known as the iPhone SE 2 or the iPhone SE 2020) is a smartphone designed and developed by Apple Inc. It was released with a starting price of US$399, and positioned as a budget phone. While the phone has a sleek, understated look that doesn’t offend, I can’t in good conscience say it looks good either. But while the iPhone SE 3 is not a looker, it packs the smartest brain in smartphones right now — the Apple A15 Bionic. This is the same 5nm chip powering the iPhone 13 series (including the top dog, the iPhone 13 Pro Max), and it’s more powerful than any other mobile SoC, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen This means the $430 iPhone SE has better brains than any Android phone right now, even the ones that cost well over $1,000. If processing power is all that you care about, the iPhone SE 3 is already a serious contender. But there’s one other group the iPhone SE 3 could appeal to — those on a tighter budget but still want an iPhone. If you’re feeling generous, the iPhone SE 3’s design can be called retro, perhaps even iconic. But if you want to be blunt: the hardware looks very dated, because it is indeed very dated: those gigantic bezels sandwiching the 4’7-inch display; the single rear camera with a jarringly small lens; and an actual physical click home button. In 2022 and the age of huge multi-camera setups and large displays with minimal bezels, this design screams “ancient”. The LCD panel has numbers that look quite underwhelming: 750 x 1334, 60Hz refresh rate, 625 nits of max brightness. But in real-world usage, the screen still looks fine. iOS’s animations have always felt smooth even at 60Hz, and the screen is small enough that the lower resolution doesn’t show as much. For me, after using large screens for so long, the 4’7-inch feels really cramped — I had trouble typing the first half a day of use, but I eventually adjusted. Apple iPhone SE 3: Cameras Camera hardware is outdated, but A15 Bionic compensates quite a bit with good lighting, video footage looks almost flagship iPhone quality — which means better than most Android cameras Camera app is fast and responsive.

(4, 'ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15', ' ZenBook is a family of Ultrabook’s – low-bulk laptop computers – produced by Asus. The first ZenBook’s were released in October 2011, and the original range of products was amended and expanded during 2012. Models range from 12-inch laptops featuring power efficient components but lacking connectivity and having only integrated graphics processors, to 15-inch laptops with discrete graphics processing units and optical disc drives. Most (though not all) ZenBook’s use Intel Core ultra-low-voltage processors and Nvidia GPUs when integrated graphics are not used. Asus introduced new models with touch screens to take advantage of Windows 8 after its release in late 2012. Most models drew comparisons to the MacBook Air. The ZenBook mainly competes against computers such as Acer\'s Aspire, Dell\'s Inspiron and XPS, HP\'s Pavilion, HP Stream and Envy, Lenovo\'s IdeaPad, Samsung\'s Sens and Toshiba\'s Satellite. ASUS designed the ZenBook’s with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity, rather than plastic, the usual laptop construction material. A pattern of concentric circles on the lids is said to represent ripples in water and represent the \"zen philosophy\" that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops. ZenBook’s have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance as well as the high-quality screens used in later models. However, the touchpad software was found to be erratic, particularly on the early models and some of the models received criticism for their high prices. \r\nSome models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power-on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging. TWO SCREENS. ZERO LIMITS.

M1 Ultra consists of 114 billion transistors, and supports up to a massive 128GB of fast unified memory. Ground breaking UltraFusion Architecture The foundation for M1 Ultra is the extremely powerful and power-efficient M1 Max. To build M1 Ultra, the die of two M1 Max is connected using UltraFusion, Apple’s custom-built packaging architecture. The most common way to scale performance is to connect two chips through a motherboard, which typically brings significant trade-offs, including increased latency, reduced bandwidth, and increased power consumption. However, Apple’s innovative UltraFusion uses a silicon interposer that connects the chips across more than 10,000 signals, providing a massive 3TB/s of low latency, inter-processor bandwidth more than 4x the bandwidth of the leading multi-chip interconnect technology.

It is a small network appliance hardware that plays received media data such as video and audio to a television set or external display. An HDMI-compliant source device, it has to be connected to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television through an HDMI cable to function. It lacks integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, either through Apple Remote and Siri Remote or some third-party infrared remotes. Apple TV runs tvOS with multiple pre-install software applications. Its media services include streaming subscriptions, TV Everywhere-based cables and broadcastings, and sports league journalisms. At the March 2019 special event, Apple highlighted their reorientation to withdraw attention on the Apple TV because of its low-rate success against the competition. To generate a higher revenue, they released Apple TV+ and Apple TV First generation Macworld San Francisco banner \"Introducing Apple TV\", January 9, 2007 in the September 2006 Apple Special Event, Apple announced the first-generation Apple TV under the brand \"itv\" to arrange it with the rest of their \"i\"-based products, but the name was later renamed to \"Apple TV\" because the British broadcasting network ITV owns the trademark in the United Kingdom. Pre-orders were available in January 2007, and the Mac Mini, bundled with a 40 GB hard disk, was released in March 2007. An update with a 160 GB HDD was released in May 2007. In January 2008, it became a stand-alone device through a software update, and it removed the requirement of iTunes syncing, making the hard disk redundant. That update also allowed media from services such as iTunes Store, MobileMe, and Flickr to be rented or purchased directly Notably in July 2008, Apple released the tvOS 2-1 software update which added external recognition for the iPhone and iPod Touch as alternative remote-control devices to the Apple Remote. In September 2015, Apple discontinued the first-generation Apple TV, with the iTunes Store accessibility being obstructed from such devices due to obsolete security standards. Second generation Apple unveiled the second-generation Apple TV in September 2010, and it added support to run a variation of iOS. It was housed in black and was one-quarter the size of the original. The device replaced the internal hard drive with an 8GB flash storage. It supported output up to 720p with HDMI. Third generation In the March 2012 Apple Special Event, Apple unveiled the third generation Apple TV. It was identical to its predecessor in external appearance, and it included a one-core deactivated dual A5 processor and 1080p output support. Apple quietly released an update \"Rev A\" in January 2013. It added support for peer-to-peer Airplay, and it replaced the processor to a single-core variant of the former A5 chip. The device also drew less power than the original third generation model. In October 2016, the company phased the updated third generation Apple TV, and its retail employees were instructed to pull units and demo units from storage shelves. In December 2017, Apple added support for the streaming service Amazon Video. The Apple TV application, bundled with Apple TV Software 7’3 was released in May 2019.  On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the fourth-generation Apple TV at an Apple Special Event. The fourth-generation model uses a new operating system, tvOS, with an app store, allowing downloads of third-party apps for video, audio, games and other content. Upon release, third-party apps were available from a limited range of providers, with new APIs providing opportunities for more apps. A requirement of new apps and games was that they must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote, which was later relaxed for games. In March 2019 Apple rebranded the device as Apple TV HD. The 4th generation includes a 64-bit Apple A8 processor, and adds support for Dolby Digital Plus audio. While similar to the form factor of the 2nd and 3rd generation models, the 4th generation model is taller. In contrast to the old remote\'s arrow button, the 4th generation Apple TV\'s touch remote uses swipe-to-select features, Siri support, a built-in microphone, volume control over HDMI CEC and IR, and an accelerometer (IMU). The fourth-generation Apple TV started shipping in October 2015. Upon launch, there were several unexpected issues such as incompatibility with Apple\'s own Remote app for iOS and watchOS. These issues were fixed by Apple on December 8, 2015 in tvOS 9. 1. On September 13, 2016, Apple released tvOS 10, bringing an all-new remote app, single-sign on, dark mode, HomeKit support, and other features. Amazon initially declined to develop an Amazon Video application for Apple TV, and announced in October 2015 it would stop selling Apple TVs, and removed 3rd generation SKUs. In late 2017 Amazon reversed their stance and released an Amazon Video app, and resumed sales of Apple TVs. 4K (first generation) At an Apple Special Event on September 12, 2017, Apple announced the Apple TV 4K which supports 2160p output, HDR10, Dolby Vision, and includes a faster Apple A10X Fusion processor supporting HEVC hardware decoding. Dolby Atmos support was added in tvOS 12. Externally it is similar to the 4th generation model, with the only differences being the addition of vents on the base, the removal of the USB-C port, and the addition of a tactile white ring around the Menu button on the included Siri Remote. 4K (second generation) On April 20, 2021, Apple announced an updated Apple TV 4K with the A12 Bionic processor, support for high frame rate HDR, HDMI 2. 1, and Wi-Fi 6. Its HDMI port supports ARC and eARC, which allows other sources plugged into the television to output audio through Apple TV, including to AirPlay speakers like HomePod. It also has the ability to pair with the ambient light sensor on iPhones with Face ID to optimize its colour output, a feature that was also extended to older Apple TVs with tvOS 14’5. AirPlay supports high frame rate HDR playback, allowing videos shot on the iPhone 12 Pro in Dolby Vision 4K 60fps to be mirrored in full resolution. Following the announcement, the previous Apple TV 4K with an A10X Fusion chip was discontinued. The model also comes with a thicker redesigned Siri Remote with a circular touchpad with navigational buttons, as well as power and mute buttons. The remote does not include an accelerometer and gyroscope, which were present in the previous Siri Remote, making it incompatible with some games. The remote is compatible with previous generation tvOS-based Apple TVs and ships with an updated SKU of the Apple TV HD.', 58, 28, 1156, 541, 20, 10),

The images were recently leaked online and reveal the colour options and the back design of the upcoming Reno 8 device. Check out the design and more details below. In a recent report citing Indian tipster Ishan Agarwal, MySmartPrice shared a high-res image (presumably a marketing image) of one of the Reno 8 devices, revealing its colourways and the back design, which is similar to that of the Reno 7 series. The device is said to feature a quad-camera setup at the back, housed inside a Samsung Galaxy S22-like contour-cut camera module that slightly protrudes. There are two large camera housings as part of the rear camera setup and two tiny sensors housed inside the third camera cut out. The leaked image also reveals that the device will be available in four colour options, namely, black, gold, green, and blue, possibly with gradient finishes. Although it is worth noting that the marketing names of these colourways may vary upon official launch. The phone is also seen with flat edges. You can take a closer look at the camera module in the image attached below. Now, it is worth mentioning that although we know that it is an image of one of the devices under the upcoming Oppo Reno 8 series, we do not know which model this is. However, amongst the alleged Reno 8, the Reno 8 SE, and the Reno 8 Pro, we presume the leaked image is for the Reno 8 Pro. Furthermore, you can probably see the “Powered by Marisilicon” branding on the camera module, which suggests that Oppo will integrate its in-house Marisilicon X Neural Processing Unit (NPU) into this device. The technology was introduced by Oppo last year at its Inno Day event and powers the Oppo Find X5 Pro’s Hasselblad-branded cameras. As for the specs, the Reno 8 Pro is expected to be the first Snapdragon 7 Gen 1-powered device in the market, which is highly expected to be introduced at Qualcomm’s China event on May 20. The vanilla Reno 8 could be powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 8100 SoC. The phones could come with a 120Hz display, various exciting camera features, support for up to 80W fast charging, and loads more. To get an idea of what the Oppo Reno 8 series is like, stay tuned for its launch in the coming days.

However, OnePlus never said anything until now. The company has now announced that it will launch the OnePlus Nord 2T in Europe this month. Here are the details. In an official blog post (as well as media invites and Twitter posts), the company has confirmed that the OnePlus Nord 2T will launch in Europe on May 19 at its Speed Games event at 3 pm CEST (6: 30 pm IST). The phone will be joined by the Nord CE 2 Lite 5G and the lineup’s first earbuds, the Nord Buds. The latter two products were recently introduced as India-firsts. The blog post also reveals that the Nord 2T will come with support for 80W SuperVOOC fast charging, much like the OnePlus 10 Pro and the second variant of the Nord CE 2 Lite. Other than that, not much has been revealed about the device. But, that’s not entirely true. The Nord 2T recently appeared on AliExpress, and hence, we have a fair idea of what to expect. The phone will reportedly come with a Nord 2-like design but with bigger camera housings. Upfront, a 6’43-inch Fluid AMOLED display with a Full HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate is expected, much like its predecessor. The phone is expected to be the first to be powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1300 SoC. The listing showed only the 8GB+128GB variant but we can expect more. The camera setup is slated to include a 50MP main camera with a Sony IMX766 sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide lens, and a 2MP B&W sensor, along with a 32MP front camera. The battery is rated at 4,500mAh battery and the company confirms support for 80W fast charging (in line with the AliExpress listing). This means the rest of the specs can be true too. The Nord 2T is said to run OxygenOS 12’1 based on Android 12. It could support Face Unlock and maybe an in-display fingerprint scanner too. As for the price, the listing hinted at a price tag of $399 (around Rs 30,600). The actual price could be somewhere around this, given that the Nord 2 was priced similarly. But these details will be confirmed once the Nord 2T launches. So, stay tuned to this space to get a better idea about the OnePlus Nord 2T.', 25, 13, 409, 260, 7, 5),

The Surface Laptop Studio offers premium features of both a laptop and a tablet, giving users a hybrid experience and is meant for developers, creative pros, designers, and gamers. So, let’s take a look at its key specs, features, and more details. The Microsoft Surface Laptop sports a 14-inch PixelSense touch display that has a resolution of 2400 x 1600 pixels and a refresh rate of 120Hz. It supports the Surface Slim Pen 2 for drawing and note-taking. However, one of the key USPs of the device is its Dynamic Woven Hinge. The special Dynamic Woven Hinge design allows users to seamlessly transition between various modes. In laptop mode, users can experience a traditional laptop with a full-size keyboard and a Windows Precision touchpad. If they want to use the touchscreen and the touchpad, they can pull the laptop forward to enter stage mode. And if they want a full tablet experience, they can rotate and put the keyboard at the back for the Studio mode. Coming to the technical aspects, the Surface Laptop Studio includes the quad-core 11th-Gen Intel Core H35 i5-11300H and H35 i7-11370H processors. For graphical needs, the Intel i5 variant gets the Intel Iris Xe GPU. The i7 models, on the other hand, can pack a 4GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050Ti GPU. The laptop comes with up to 32GB of LPDDR4x RAM and 2TB of removable SSD storage. Moreover, the device can run up to 19 hours on a single charge. As for the I/O, the Surface Laptop Studio comes with 2x Thunderbolt 4 ports, a Surface Connect port, and a 3’5mm audio jack. Other than these, there is a 1080p webcam at the front that supports Windows Hello face recognition technology. Furthermore, there is a built-in quad-omnisonic speaker system with Dolby Atmos support for an immersive audio experience. And as you would expect, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio runs Windows 11 Home out-of-the-box. It also comes equipped with DFCI, Microsoft Endpoint Manager, and Windows Autopilot.

Late last year, we saw leaks about Poco’s plans to enter the laptop segment in India, as two laptop batteries under the Poco brand were spotted on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) database. Now, a Redmi G-series laptop battery with the model number G16B01W has been spotted on the BIS website. And well, it is listed under the Poco brand, suggesting the imminent launch of a Poco laptop in India soon. The recent report comes from reliable tipster Mukul Sharma, who initially spotted the listing on the BIS database. The tipster then shared the information with 91Mobiles. So, as per the report by the publication, the Redmi G-series battery, a 3,620mAh cell (15’2V, 55’02Wh), is essentially a replacement battery meant for the Redmi G gaming laptop that was launched in China recently. So, this could mean that Poco might be aiming to launch a gaming-focused laptop – possibly a rebranded Redmi G gaming laptop in India soon. So, let’s take a look at the expected specs and features of the Poco laptop. Now, as the Chinese giant often rebrands Xiaomi and Redmi devices for the global market, it is possible that Poco might rebrand the Redmi G (2021) Gaming laptop and launch it under its own brand name in India. If that is the case, the Poco laptop should come with the same specs and features as the Redmi G Gaming laptop. Hence, we can expect the Poco laptop to boast a 16’1-inch Full HD display with support for a 144Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 1920 x 1080p. The laptop could be configured with either the 11th-Gen Intel Core i5-11260H CPU or the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor. The Intel variant could come with the Nvidia RTX 3050 GPU along with Intel’s Iris XE integrated graphics, while the AMD version could feature the Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU with integrated Radeon graphics. The Poco laptop, if the company chooses to make it a gaming device, could also come with the Hurricane Cooling 3’0 system that features five copper heat pipes, 12V fans, and four air outlets to battle thermal issues. Moreover, the device could come with support for Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5’1, and you might be able to connect up to three 4K monitors to the laptop simultaneously. Now, all these specs and features are of the Redmi G (2021) gaming laptop. And Poco has not confirmed, not even teased, anything about its laptop just yet. So, if the company chooses to fit the Redmi G-series battery listed on the BIS database in a brand new device, the above specs will not matter. So, we suggest you wait for Poco to officially announce the device, which could happen sooner rather than later.', 20, 8, 466, 193, 8, 4),

They can be paired with up to 8GB of GDDR6 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU for maximum graphical performance. Furthermore, Dell has taken a page out of its premium Alienware line to design the thermal system for the new G15 models that include dual air-intake, ultra-thin fans, copper pipes, and strategically positioned air vents. As a result, the laptops also come with the Alienware Command Centre software for users to easily monitor and manage the thermal and overall systems of the devices.

Late last year, we also saw a report suggesting that Oppo might launch its own tablets and notebooks this year. And now, recent rumors suggest that the Chinese giant is looking to unveil its first tablet (reportedly dubbed as the Oppo Pad) in China soon, following which it might bring the device to India as well. \r\nThe report comes from 91Mobiles, citing tipster Mukul Sharma, and states that Oppo will likely launch its first tablet in India in the first half of 2022. But the China launch is expected sooner and could happen as soon as later this month.

However, as per previous leaks, Oppo’s tablet device might feature a high-refresh-rate IPS LCD panel, presumably with support for a 120Hz refresh rate. It is rumored to pack a 13MP rear camera and an 8MP selfie snapper at the front. Under the hood, the Oppo Pad could come with the Snapdragon 870 SoC, paired with 6GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, under the hood. The device is also rumored to run the Android 12-based ColorOS 12 skin out of the box. As for the pricing, it is rumored to launch with a price tag of CNY 2,000 (~Rs 23,563) in China, which is steep but in line with other competitors, including and especially the Xiaomi Pad 5.

According to the reputable tipster Digital Chat Station, Realme is looking to launch its next-gen tablet with 5G support soon and it could be called the Realme Pad 5G Master Explorer edition in China. This comes after Realme’s Madhav Sheth recently confirmed that it will launch a 5G tablet soon. The company has reportedly developed two prototypes of the upcoming tablet, both of which pack Snapdragon chips. As per the leakster’s Weibo post, one of the prototypes, which is likely the lower-end model, sports a 2’5K LCD display with support for a 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 870 SoC, and an 8,360mAh battery. The tablet is also expected to support a stylus to compete with the likes of the Xiaomi Pad 5, which recently reached the Indian shores. There could be a high-end tablet model too, which is tipped to feature the now-delayed Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ chipset. Hence, we expect Realme to launch its tablet after Qualcomm launches the said chipset in the second half of 2022. However, other than this, not much is known about this Realme Pad model. Other details regarding both versions of the Realme Pad 5G are also under the wraps as of now.

(26, 'Snapdragon 845', ' Qualcomm has announced that it is working with Google on a common development infrastructure that will help OEMs to better implement Project Treble in their devices. As part of the process, the chipmaker says it has optimized several of its mobile SoCs for Android P. The Snapdragon 845, Snapdragon 660 and Snapdragon 636 are the three chips that were apparently fine-tuned for the upcoming version of Android as part of Qualcomm’s partnership with Google that allowed the chip-maker to have early access to the latest builds of Android, enabling it to make the changes necessary for OEMs to update their devices faster. According to Qualcomm, devices powered by the aforementioned Snapdragon SoCs should have access to Android P up to 12 weeks earlier than usual. It is, however, worth noting that it will still be up to the OEMs to actually issue the updates, so there’s still no guarantee that the update schedule will magically get any faster from now on. Fragmentation is one issue that has continued to plague Android ever since its inception. As was revealed once again by Google’s latest Android Platform Distribution numbers for May 2018, the world’s most popular mobile operating system continues to remain a highly-fragmented platform. Most of that fragmentation is because of the extreme reluctance on part of the OEMs and vendors to push out timely updates to their respective devices, which means that millions of people around the world are forced to use older, unsecured and deprecated versions of the software. Google has sought to change all that with Project Treble, which seeks to hasten the update process for Android smartphones and tablets by modularizing Android, thereby separating the OS framework code from vendor-specific hardware code. It will be interesting to see if we actually get faster updates for devices powered by these chips or if it will continue to be more of the same in the days to come.', 10, 9, 319, 283, 6, 5),

Here’s when to expect the launch. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ Launch Timeline Tipped. A recent report suggests that Qualcomm will release the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ chipset in May. To recall, last year’s Snapdragon 888+ was introduced in June so the possibility of this information being true can be high. It is further revealed that the new high-end Snapdragon SoC will be codenamed SM8475 and will be based on TSMC’s 4nm process node, becoming the first Snapdragon chipset to use the TSMC process node. For those who don’t know, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 mobile platform is based on Samsung’s 4nm process tech, which has reportedly caused overheating and performance throttling issues in some of the high-end phones. The switch to TSMC’s fabrication process could be with the aim to resolve such issues with the launch of the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 variant. Other technical details remain unknown but we can safely expect some CPU and GPU performance improvements and more. As for the devices, which will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+, nothing concrete is available at the moment. However, a previous rumor suggested that the yet-to-be-announced Xiaomi 12 Ultra will get the new Qualcomm chipset. Phones from OEMs like Motorola, OnePlus, and more can follow suit. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ smartphones are likely to be released starting in June 2022. In addition, Qualcomm is expected to introduce new Snapdragon 700-series chipsets at the same time. More details are expected to be available once the chipset gets introduced. We can expect Qualcomm to reveal the launch timeline soon.

The watch also packs in a heart rate sensor, activity tracker, sleep tracker, and 9 sleep modes. Keeping all of this humming along is a 210mAh battery that the company claims will allow the watch to be used for 14 days on a single charge. The watch comes with a removable silicone strap, which means you can replace it with a different strap if the default band is not to your liking. Plus, if you’re worried about taking it out in the rain, the watch comes with IP68 rating, and is water-resistant up to 1’5 metres for 30 minutes, which is great and on-par with some of the best budget smartwatches out there. The Xiaomi Haylou Smart Watch is clearly aimed at budget users, and while that may not be very obvious from its features, it’s clear because the company is crowdfunding it for just 99 Yuan (around ₹1,000) right now. After the crowdfunding is over, the watch will be available at a retail price of 119 Yuan, which is around ₹1,200 and that’s an incredible price for a smartwatch.', 12, 6, 311, 153, 6, 3),

This does line up with the aforementioned tip, which means we could see the Redmi Watch debut next month. There’s no official confirmation though and it could just be the long-rumored Redmi K30 Ultra 5G. As for the existence of the Redmi Watch, well, it is very real.

This listing appeared earlier this year and if I were to guess, Xiaomi will take on the affordable Realme Watch with its Redmi counterpart in the sub-Rs. 4,000 price segments.

It was released with a starting price of US$399, and positioned as a budget phone. While the phone has a sleek, understated look that doesn’t offend, I can’t in good conscience say it looks good either. But while the iPhone SE 3 is not a looker, it packs the smartest brain in smartphones right now — the Apple A15 Bionic. This is the same 5nm chip powering the iPhone 13 series (including the top dog, the iPhone 13 Pro Max), and it’s more powerful than any other mobile SoC, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen This means the $430 iPhone SE has better brains than any Android phone right now, even the ones that cost well over $1,000. If processing power is all that you care about, the iPhone SE 3 is already a serious contender. But there’s one other group the iPhone SE 3 could appeal to — those on a tighter budget but still want an iPhone. If you’re feeling generous, the iPhone SE 3’s design can be called retro, perhaps even iconic. But if you want to be blunt: the hardware looks very dated, because it is indeed very dated: those gigantic bezels sandwiching the 4’7-inch display; the single rear camera with a jarringly small lens; and an actual physical click home button. In 2022 and the age of huge multi-camera setups and large displays with minimal bezels, this design screams “ancient”. The LCD panel has numbers that look quite underwhelming: 750 x 1334, 60Hz refresh rate, 625 nits of max brightness. But in real-world usage, the screen still looks fine. iOS’s animations have always felt smooth even at 60Hz, and the screen is small enough that the lower resolution doesn’t show as much. For me, after using large screens for so long, the 4’7-inch feels really cramped — I had trouble typing the first half a day of use, but I eventually adjusted.

The first ZenBook’s were released in October 2011, and the original range of products was amended and expanded during 2012. Models range from 12-inch laptops featuring power efficient components but lacking connectivity and having only integrated graphics processors, to 15-inch laptops with discrete graphics processing units and optical disc drives. Most (though not all) ZenBook’s use Intel Core ultra-low-voltage processors and Nvidia GPUs when integrated graphics are not used. Asus introduced new models with touch screens to take advantage of Windows 8 after its release in late 2012. Most models drew comparisons to the MacBook Air. The ZenBook mainly competes against computers such as Acer\'s Aspire, Dell\'s Inspiron and XPS, HP\'s Pavilion, HP Stream and Envy, Lenovo\'s IdeaPad, Samsung\'s Sens and Toshiba\'s Satellite. ASUS designed the ZenBook’s with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity, rather than plastic, the usual laptop construction material. A pattern of concentric circles on the lids is said to represent ripples in water and represent the \"zen philosophy\" that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops. ZenBook’s have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance as well as the high-quality screens used in later models. However, the touchpad software was found to be erratic, particularly on the early models and some of the models received criticism for their high prices. Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power-on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging.

The new SoC consists of 114 billion transistors, the most ever in a personal computer chip. “M1 Ultra is another game-changer for Apple silicon that once again will shock the PC industry. M1 Ultra consists of 114 billion transistors, and supports up to a massive 128GB of fast unified memory. However, Apple’s innovative UltraFusion uses a silicon interposer that connects the chips across more than 10,000 signals, providing a massive 3TB/s of low latency, inter-processor bandwidth more than 4x the bandwidth of the leading multi-chip interconnect technology. The 20-core CPU of M1 Ultra delivers 90 percent higher multi-threaded performance than the fastest available 16-core PC desktop chip in the same power envelope. M1 Ultra reaches the peak performance of the fastest available 16-core PC desktop chip using 100 fewer watts of power. For the most graphics-intensive needs, like 3D rendering and complex image processing, M1 Ultra has a 64-core GPU — 8x the size of M1 — delivering faster performance than even the highest-end PC GPU \r\navailable while using 200 fewer watts of power. The 32-core Neural Engine in M1 Ultra runs up to 22 trillion operations per second, speeding through the most challenging machine learning tasks. Developer technologies like Metal let apps take full advantage of the new chip, and optimisations in Core ML utilise the new 32-core Neural Engine, so machine learning models run faster than ever. Apps that have not yet been updated to Universal will run seamlessly with Apple’s Rosetta 2 technology.

Control lights, locks and thermostats with your iPhone — or just your voice. And elevate movie night with theatre-like picture and sound. Apple TV is a digital media player and micro console that is developed and marketed by Apple. It is a small network appliance hardware that plays received media data such as video and audio to a television set or external display. An HDMI-compliant source device, it has to be connected to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television through an HDMI cable to function. It lacks integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, either through Apple Remote and Siri Remote or some third-party infrared remotes. At the March 2019 special event, Apple highlighted their reorientation to withdraw attention on the Apple TV because of its low-rate success against the competition. Second generation Apple unveiled the second-generation Apple TV in September 2010, and it added support to run a variation of iOS. It was housed in black and was one-quarter the size of the original. The device replaced the internal hard drive with an 8GB flash storage. It was identical to its predecessor in external appearance, and it included a one-core deactivated dual A5 processor and 1080p output support. Apple quietly released an update \"Rev A\" in January 2013. It added support for peer-to-peer Airplay, and it replaced the processor to a single-core variant of the former A5 chip. The device also drew less power than the original third generation model. In October 2016, the company phased the updated third generation Apple TV, and its retail employees were instructed to pull units and demo units from storage shelves. In December 2017, Apple added support for the streaming service Amazon Video. The Apple TV application, bundled with Apple TV Software 7’3 was released in May 2019. A requirement of new apps and games was that they must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote, which was later relaxed for games. The 4th generation includes a 64-bit Apple A8 processor, and adds support for Dolby Digital Plus audio. Upon launch, there were several unexpected issues such as incompatibility with Apple\'s own Remote app for iOS and watchOS. These issues were fixed by Apple on December 8, 2015 in tvOS 9. Amazon initially declined to develop an Amazon Video application for Apple TV, and announced in October 2015 it would stop selling Apple TVs, and removed 3rd generation SKUs. In late 2017 Amazon reversed their stance and released an Amazon Video app, and resumed sales of Apple TVs. It also has the ability to pair with the ambient light sensor on iPhones with Face ID to optimize its colour output, a feature that was also extended to older Apple TVs with tvOS 14’5. AirPlay supports high frame rate HDR playback, allowing videos shot on the iPhone 12 Pro in Dolby Vision 4K 60fps to be mirrored in full resolution. The model also comes with a thicker redesigned Siri Remote with a circular touchpad with navigational buttons, as well as power and mute buttons.

To recall, last year’s Snapdragon 888+ was introduced in June so the possibility of this information being true can be high. It is further revealed that the new high-end Snapdragon SoC will be codenamed SM8475 and will be based on TSMC’s 4nm process node, becoming the first Snapdragon chipset to use the TSMC process node. For those who don’t know, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 mobile platform is based on Samsung’s 4nm process tech, which has reportedly caused overheating and performance throttling issues in some of the high-end phones. The switch to TSMC’s fabrication process could be with the aim to resolve such issues with the launch of the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 variant. Other technical details remain unknown but we can safely expect some CPU and GPU performance improvements and more. However, a previous rumor suggested that the yet-to-be-announced Xiaomi 12 Ultra will get the new Qualcomm chipset. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+ smartphones are likely to be released starting in June 2022. In addition, Qualcomm is expected to introduce new Snapdragon 700-series chipsets at the same time. More details are expected to be available once the chipset gets introduced.', '27.png'),

Over the last few months, Xiaomi has launched quite a bunch of smartwatches in China. However, it seems that the company isn’t resting yet when it comes to smartwatch offerings and has now started crowdfunding yet another smartwatch in its home country. Keeping all of this humming along is a 210mAh battery that the company claims will allow the watch to be used for 14 days on a single charge. The Xiaomi Haylou Smart Watch is clearly aimed at budget users, and while that may not be very obvious from its features, it’s clear because the company is crowdfunding it for just 99 Yuan (around ₹1,000) right now. After the crowdfunding is over, the watch will be available at a retail price of 119 Yuan, which is around ₹1,200 and that’s an incredible price for a smartwatch.', '28.png'),
(29, 'Smart Watch', 'Redmi Watch', 'ADMIN', '2022-05-18', 5, 0, ' Xiaomi with Redmi going independent from the core Mi brand, Xiaomi has started to build a huge product ecosystem under both its brands. The latter still continues to cater more to the premium segment as compared to the affordable offerings of the Redmi brand. Now, it’s being rumored that the company is set to launch a Redmi Watch as well. The tip about the upcoming launch of the Redmi Watch first came from well-known and reputed tipster Digital Chat Station on Weibo. The post (translated from Chinese to English) explicitly said – “Redmi first smart watch coming soon”. I know most of you may not simply want to take the word of a tipster for the smartwatch launch. As seen below, a poster for 818 Jindong mobile phone festival has now appeared on Weibo suggesting that we will see a new Redmi product launch on 14th August. This does line up with the aforementioned tip, which means we could see the Redmi Watch debut next month. We have already seen a Redmi product with model number HMSH01GE bagging certification under the ‘smartwatch’ category. This listing appeared earlier this year and if I were to guess, Xiaomi will take on the affordable Realme Watch with its Redmi counterpart in the sub-Rs. If Xiaomi launches a Redmi Watch in the coming days, it will sit alongside the Redmi Band under the wearable segment. We expect the Chinese giant to bring Mi Band 4C to India very soon – possibly during its ecosystem event in September.', '29.png'),
